## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/connecthub
   cd connecthub
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Go to Settings > API to get your project URL and anon key

     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     ```

4. **Set up the database**
   Run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL editor:

   ```sql
   -- Create profiles table
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS profiles (
     id uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     email text NOT NULL,
     full_name text NOT NULL,
     bio text,
     avatar_url text,
     created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
     updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
   );

   -- Create posts table
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS posts (
     id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     author_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     content text NOT NULL,
     created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
     updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
   );

   -- Enable RLS
   ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- RLS Policies for profiles
   CREATE POLICY "Users can read all profiles"
     ON profiles FOR SELECT
     TO authenticated
     USING (true);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
     ON profiles FOR UPDATE
     TO authenticated
     USING (auth.uid() = id);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile"
     ON profiles FOR INSERT
     TO authenticated
     WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

   -- RLS Policies for posts
   CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read posts"
     ON posts FOR SELECT
     TO authenticated
     USING (true);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can create posts"
     ON posts FOR INSERT
     TO authenticated
     WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = author_id);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can update own posts"
     ON posts FOR UPDATE
     TO authenticated
     USING (auth.uid() = author_id);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own posts"
     ON posts FOR DELETE
     TO authenticated
     USING (auth.uid() = author_id);
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
